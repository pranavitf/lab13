 Answers to the 5 Questions

1. Is there a fault in the program? If so, locate it and explain.

Yes.
Location: Line 21: for (int i = 1; i < attendance_records.size(); ++i).

Explanation: 
The loop initializes the index i to 1. 
In C++, vectors are 0-indexed. This causes the program to skip the first lecture (index 0) entirely. 
The loop should start with int i = 0.

2. Define a test case that does not execute the fault.

Answer: Impossible.


Reason: 
The instructions require a test case with an attendance record of 10 values. 
To process this input, the function must execute the for loop.
The fault is located in the loop initialization (int i = 1).
Therefore, any call to the function with a vector of size 10 will inevitably execute the faulty line of code initializing the loop.


3. Define a test case that executes the fault but does not result in an error state.

Test Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (All Present)

Explanation:

Fault Executed: The loop starts at i=1, skipping index 0.

No Error State: The student was present (1) at index 0. Even though the program skipped this index, the internal variable absent_count remains 0.
The correct absent_count for a present student is also 0. Since the calculated state matches the expected state, no error state occurs regarding the count.

Expected Output: 0 (False/Pass)

Actual Output: 0 (False/Pass)

4. Define a test case that results in an error state but not a failure.

Test Input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (Absent at index 0, Present elsewhere)

Explanation:

Error State: The student was absent (0) at index 0. The program skips this.
The program's absent_count is 0. The correct absent_count should be 1. The internal state is now incorrect (Error State).


No Failure: The threshold for failing the course is 3 absences. The student has 1 actual absence.
The program counts 0 absences. Both 1 and 0 are less than 3. The function returns False (Pass), which is the correct external behavior.

Expected Output: 0 (False/Pass)

Actual Output: 0 (False/Pass)

5. Define a test case that results in failure.

Test Input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (Absent at index 0, 1, and 2)

Explanation:

Failure: The student has exactly 3 absences, so they should fail the course (Return True).

The program skips index 0 (an absence). It counts only index 1 and 2.

Program calculates absent_count = 2.

Program evaluates 2 >= 3 as False.

The program outputs False (Pass) when it should output True (Fail). The external behavior deviates from the expected outcome.

Expected Output: 1 (True/Fail)

Actual Output: 0 (False/Pass)
